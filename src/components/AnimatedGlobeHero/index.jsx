/**
 * AnimatedGlobeHero
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A cinematic, premium globe hero section featuring:
 *  - A photorealistic, procedurally textured Earth (no bitmap dependencies)
 *  - Smooth continuous 360° rotation via a clipped texture pan
 *  - Cinematic curved connection arcs that lift, travel, and land between cities
 *  - Layered atmospheric glow tuned to match a warm-horizon sky gradient
 *  - Minimal glass-morphism stat cards with subtle float + shimmer
 *
 * Notes on implementation:
 *  - Earth surface is built from layered <feTurbulence> noise filters, giving
 *    organic continent / cloud / terminator detail without external assets.
 *  - The "rotation" is a wide texture strip clipped to the globe sphere; it
 *    pans horizontally on loop, which reads as a true 360° spin and avoids
 *    the stretched look of rotating a circular mask.
 *  - Arcs use SVG offset-path for the comet head + a synchronized stroke
 *    reveal for the trail — both share the same cubic-bezier curve so the
 *    head sits perfectly on the trail's leading edge.

/* ============================================================================
 * PARTICLE GLOBE
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The globe IS the particles. There is no hand-over.
 *
 * The previous version was a crossfade: particles formed a shell, then faded
 * to zero opacity while a separately-rendered SVG sphere faded up underneath
 * them. That swap is what read as the globe "popping" into existence — the
 * thing you watched being built was thrown away and replaced at the moment it
 * finished. Here the same particles that converge are the ones that stay, and
 * the SVG sphere surface underneath is gone entirely (see SHOW_SVG_SPHERE).
 *
 * THE FORMATION
 * Each particle owns a fixed home on the unit sphere and spawns far out along
 * a random direction. It converges by interpolating DIRECTION and RADIUS
 * separately:
 *
 *   direction : normalised lerp from spawn direction toward home direction
 *   radius    : eased lerp from a wide scatter radius down to the shell
 *
 * Interpolating the direction rather than the raw xyz is what makes the
 * approach curve instead of running dead straight at the centre — the swarm
 * sweeps around the sphere as it tightens. A per-particle tangential swirl,
 * decaying to zero as it lands, adds the spiral. Nothing snaps: every particle
 * has its own delay and duration, so the surface knits together over ~2.6s.
 *
 * THE LIVING GLOBE
 * After forming, the particles keep their homes and the whole field rotates on
 * a tilted axis, permanently. Depth is real: every particle is transformed in
 * 3D, projected through a perspective divide, and its size and brightness come
 * from its own z. Back-hemisphere particles dim and shrink, which is what
 * makes a field of flat dots read as a solid rotating body.
 *
 * A lattice of meridians and parallels is built from the SAME particle system,
 * just seeded on a grid instead of a spiral — so the structure of the sphere is
 * drawn by particles too, rather than being an overlay on top of them.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE
 * Where the old burst ran ~4.4s and then stopped, this runs for as long as the
 * section is on screen, so it is built to be cheap per frame:
 *   - all particle data in flat Float32Arrays, no objects, no per-frame allocation
 *   - sin/cos of each home baked once at init; the hot loop is multiply-add
 *   - no depth sort; depth is expressed through alpha and size, which is
 *     indistinguishable at this dot size and saves an O(n log n) sort per frame
 *   - fillRect rather than arc(): far cheaper, and identical below ~2px
 *   - alpha quantised to 1/64 so long runs share a fillStyle string
 *   - the parent's IntersectionObserver stops the loop entirely off-screen
 * ========================================================================== */

       Three groups, one system — every one of them is a particle that flies in
       during formation, so the whole Earth is genuinely assembled rather than
       revealed:

         LAND    dense and bright, placed only where the real landmask says
                 there is land, so the continents are the actual continents.
         OCEAN   sparse and dim, so the sphere still reads as a solid body
                 between the landmasses instead of a floating archipelago.
         RIM     a great circle on the silhouette. This replaces the SVG ring
                 that used to sweep around the globe: it is made of the same
                 particles, scattered and converging from all around exactly
                 like the rest of the swarm, just landing a beat later.

       Land is oversampled relative to its ~30% area share — roughly 60% of the
       surface budget — because dots on a sphere read much sparser than pixels
       on a flat map, and the continents have to survive being spread over a
       hemisphere and dimmed by depth.

       Counts are a measured budget, not a guess. This runs permanently rather
       than for four seconds, and it is fill-rate bound: every particle is an
       additively-blended rect over a 2160x912 backing store. At 11.7k the
       measured cost was 50ms/frame (18fps) even with GPU rasterisation. The
       spend is therefore concentrated where it is visible — land keeps its
       density because the continents have to be legible; ocean and lattice are
       thinned hard because they are dim anyway and were paying full price for
       almost no visual return. */

       TWO PASSES, and it has to be two. The obvious single-pass version —
       walk the spiral, keep points until each bucket is full — silently
       destroys the distribution: the spiral runs pole to pole, so a bucket
       fills from whichever pole it starts at and everything past that point is
       dropped. At these counts ocean filled inside the top 4% of the sphere
       and land inside the top 46%, leaving the globe as a lopsided blob with
       an empty southern half.

           This rule used to carry, alongside the reveal animation:

               transform-origin: 640px 270px;   (i.e. CX, CY)
           and that is what made the ring appear to fly in from the side.
           fill-box resolves transform-origin from the group's OWN bounding-box
           corner rather than from SVG user space. The outer halo circle is
           r = R + 60 = 235, so this group's bbox starts near (405, 35) — which
           put the origin at roughly user-space (1045, 305), about 405 units
           right of the globe's actual centre. globeReveal scales 0.85 -> 1, so
           the whole group (rings, halos and all) started ~61 units to the RIGHT
           and slid left into place. With no transform at all there is no origin
           to get wrong and nothing to slide.

           Retimed too: 1.4s -> 2.9s, where it used to be 2.6s -> 3.9s. The rim
           particles are in flight from ~0.95s and land between ~1.75s and
           ~2.65s (see the rim spawn block), so the stroke now firms up
           underneath them AS they arrive — the ring densifies out of the
           converging particles instead of fading in after they had already
           finished. The ease keeps it imperceptible early, so nothing pops. */
